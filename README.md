# Introduction

A 3D human motor neuron disease platform for high throughput drug screening.
The goal of this package is to load the 3D images acquired of neurospheres and segment nuclei and Islet1 positive nuclei from their respective channels.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project can be found in BioImage Archive with accession number [S-BIAD1737](https://doi.org/10.6019/S-BIAD1737).

## Installation

Install the [conda](https://conda.io) package, dependency and environment manager.

You can download this repository from the green `Code` button and download and zip, or through the command line with

    cd <path to any folder of choice>
    git clone https://github.com/BIIFSweden/AI4Life_OC2_2024_38.git

Then create the `neuroscan` conda environment:

    cd <path to your 'AI4Life_OC2_2024_38' directory>
    conda env create -f environment.yml

This will install all necessary project dependencies as well as the `neuroscan` companion package (editable install).

## Usage

Copy all project data to the [data](data) directory (or use symbolic links).

Then run [Jupyter Lab](https://jupyter.org) from within the `neuroscan` conda environment:

    cd <path to your 'AI4Life_OC2_2024_38' directory>
    conda activate neuroscan
    jupyter-lab

All analysis notebooks can be found in the [notebooks](notebooks) directory.

Or you can use the following command to analyze a folder.

    conda activate neuroscan
    neuroscan segment <path to folder>

This will add two TIFF labeled images containing the instance segmentation for nuclei and motor neurons in separate files.

# Rationale

Should you want to delve deeper into how the pipeline was developed, please go to the `notebooks` folder.
You can find three notebooks.
The [data_loading.ipynb](notebooks/data_loading.ipynb) describes how images are loaded.
The [nuclei_segmentation.ipynb](notebooks/nuclei_segmentation.ipynb) describes how nuclei are segmented from the nuclei channel.
The [motor_segmentation.ipynb](notebooks/motor_segmentation.ipynb) describes how motor neurons are segmented from the motor neuron channel.

# Conclusion

[AI4Life](https://ai4life.eurobioimaging.eu)  is a Horizon Europe-funded project that brings together the computational and life science communities.

AI4Life has received funding from the European Union’s Horizon Europe research and innovation programme under grant agreement number 101057970.
